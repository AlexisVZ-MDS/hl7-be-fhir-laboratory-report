<p>This Guidance page aims to clarify the definition of the Belgian laboratory result.
It concerns the construction of a laboratory report in a HL7 FHIR format. This laboratory report is able to identify itself as a temporary, replacement, final or corrected version.
</p>
<p>
The text here does not aim to explain the HL7 FHIR standard as such nor does this guide aim to explain all the possibilities of the HL7 FHIR standard. For any exhaustive overview of the FHIR standard, the pages by HL7 are considered sufficient. Instead, the focus of this guide is to give as pragmatic and concise as possible the pointers needed to create a valid HL7 FHIR laboratory result concerning a human patient in the Belgian context. The reader of this text shall take note of the FHIR artefacts that are also included in this Implementation Guide. The pointers given on this page cannot be understood without them.</p>



<h3>Conventions</h3>

<h4>Note on values and decimal mark</h4>
<p>Values are always expressed with the 'full stop' or point (.) as decimal mark. Commas SHALL NOT be used to make numbers easier to read. (e.g. ten thousand is always written as '10000' â€“ never as '10,000' or '10.000')</p>

<h4>UTF 8</h4>
<p>The HL7 FHIR message is considered to be UTF-8. It is RECOMMENDED to declare the use of UTF-8 at the top when sending FHIR as XML.</p>


<h3>The structure of report</h3>
<p>The content of the report is described in detail in the profile. This chapter highlights some general attention points in the structure. </p>
<p>The profile defines cardinalities, preferred codesystems etc. It is equally important to take note of the different descriptions explaining the elements in the profile. These descriptions contain information that would otherwise by typically found in a cookbook explaining a technical structure element by element.</p>


<h4>Main FHIR resource of the report: the DiagnosticReport</h4>
<p>The main FHIR resource to express the laboratory report is the DiagnosticReport. A Belgian profile has thus been created to use this resource in the intended fashion.</p>
<p>This DiagnosticReport forms the high level structure around all the actual concrete information in the laboratory report e.g. the actual observations, the patient etc.</p>

<h4>Referencing other FHIR resources</h4>
<p>As FHIR provides different resources, the DiagnosticReport will reference many other FHIR resources such as Patient, Practitioner, Specimen etc.</p>
<p>FHIR allows for <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html">multiple ways to reference</a> other resources. For example, these other resources can be referenced using a URL to a server or they can be added to the DiagnosticReport as contained resources to have everything available in the DiagnosticReport.</p>

<h4>Role of the narrative in FHIR</h4>
<p>Implementers SHALL explicitely take note of the rules around the narrative in FHIR <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/narrative.html">as explained on the pages of HL7.</a></p>
<p>Specifically, the strong recommendation of HL7 concerning the use of the narrative "to support human-consumption as a fallback" is important in the context of the laboratory report. Indeed, this "human-consumption" aspect actually concerns the inclusion of limited xhtml content and as such an effortless implementation to visualize the content of the report by consuming systems is guarantueed. Also, for systems that might not initially choose to consume reports in a structured way, this guarantuees a way to at least visualize and present the content to the user. </p>
<p>In the Belgian laboratory report, all content SHALL be available in the structured elements. As such, a narrative with <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-narrative-status.html">narrative-status 'additional'</a> SHALL NOT be used.</p>

<h4>Specimen overview</h4>
<p>Every specimen is expressed as a seperate Specimen resource in FHIR.</p>
<p>In the DiagnosticReport.specimen element, all the specimen are referenced.</p>
<p>The actual Observations refer to these Specimen.</p>

<h4>Grouping of observations using Observation resources</h4>
<p>Naturally, the Observation resource is heavily used in the laboratory report.</p>
<p>It SHALL be noted, the FHIR DiagnosticReport base standard resource takes a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/diagnosticreport.html#bnc">pragmatic approach</a> to dealing with the multiple observations.</p>
<p>Basically, to fully understand the DiagnosticReport and the Observation resource it is key to understand a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html#obsgrouping">few basic distinct ways to group observations</a> and how they cater to different use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the .result of the DiagnosticReport resource to reference 0..* Observation: that way multiple Observation are referenced in the root of the report. These will cater to reports that give back 0..* results without any complex structure between the results. These Observation resource might however leverage more complex structures by also following the strategy described in the following options.</li>
<li>The Observation itself may include 0..* .component elements. A component element within an Observation is a list of key/value pairs with optionally for each key/value pair a data absent reason and/or an interpretation code and/or a referenceRange. Such a list of key/value pairs is considered to be part of one Observation. A typical example is to include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement. "Components should only be used when there is only one method, one observation, one performer, one device, and one time."</li>
<li>The Observation may be part of a group of Observation resources. This is established by using the .hasMember in the Observation. Typically, this is used for a panel or battery where the panel code is given without a value in the parent Observation and the actual results are seperate Observation resources referenced from that parent Observation</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, including 0..* Observation in a report always happen by using the first method. These Observation resources might be (relatively) simple or have a complex structure.</p>
<h4>Using subtitles</h4>
<p>An important requirement is the ability to use subtitles in the structure of the laboratory report.</p>
<p>This can be done in the report by leveraging the third way to use observations grouping supra. When doing this with the goal of only adding a subtitle, the CodeableConcept datatype of the .code element in the parent Observation will minimally contain the .text element.</p>
<h4>Important time elements</h4>
<p>This chapter gives a quick overview of where to find the most important time elements in a laboratory report.</p>

<h5>Time of the prescription</h5>
<p>The time of the prescription lives in the original ServiceRequest resource that is referenced in the DiagnosticReport.basedOn element. The time of the prescription lives in the ServiceRequest.authoredOn element.</p>
<h5>Time of the specimen collection</h5>
<p>This is part of the Specimen resource that is referenced from within the diagnostic report. The Specimen.collection.collected element gives the dateTime or period of the collection.</p>
<h5>Time of the specimen reception</h5>
<p>This is part of the Specimen resource that is referenced from within the diagnostic report. The Specimen.receivedTime element gives the dateTime of the collection.</p>
<h5>Time when the report is created</h5>
<p>This is the DiagnosticReport.issued element.</p>

<h4>Versioning of reports</h4>
<p>The base FHIR resource DiagnosticReport is of the FHIR type DomainResource and as such it inherits the base FHIR resource elements. In its root, it inherits the elements defined in the base Resource FHIR datatype. This includes the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource.html#Meta">Resource Metadata</a>.</p>
<p>The Resource Metadata contains in its .versionId the actual version of the DiagnosticReport.</p>
<p>The laboratory report SHALL identify itself uniquely using a business identifier in the DiagnosticReport.identifier element</p>
<p>More recent versions of a labaratory result that have the same .identifier are considered as a correction or new version of the laboratory report.</p>
<p>Some extra data concerning the status of the DiagnosticReport report can be found in its .status element. This element provides the <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-diagnostic-report-status.html">possibility to add a status like 'corrected', 'final' etc.</a> It is noted also the Observation resources that are part of the report have in their structure each also a .status element.</p>

  <h3>FHIR technical specifics</h3>
  <h4>The federal IG</h4>
<p>This guide uses the artefacts and guidance as they are defined in <a href="https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/kmehr/en/page/fhir-profiles">the official federal IG as published by eHealth Platform</a>. Implementers SHALL take note of the guidelines defined in that IG. Please take note when you are technically validating against the IG described on this page you also need that IG for the base federal profiles.</p>

<h4>Technical implementation of the specification published here</h4>
<p>As per the FHIR standard specifications, there are multiple ways in how the report can be exchanged or requested.</p>
<p>A POC phase for this project will normally investigate a few possibilities. It is however expected the laboratory will probably be (also)exchanged under some form of FHIR Bundle in which the different used resources are fully available as seperate entries.</p>
<p>If an implementation makes the choice to deliver the report under the form of a 'FHIR document', <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/documents.html#content">the extra Composition resource that is needed in a FHIR document</a> SHALL be considered as it contains many mandatory elements such as general author of the document and the date of the document.</p>
<p>Specifically, when leveraging the FHIR document structure, it SHALL be considered the document as a whole has an .identifier and a .status.</p>
<p>The Composition resource in the document structure provides for the creation of extra 'sections' in a document, this is something that is not available in the same way in the base diagnosticReport resource and implementers SHALL exercise caution when using this in the context of laboratory reporting.</p>
